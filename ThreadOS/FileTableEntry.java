/**
 * In memory object representation of an inode
 * Used to simplify how we interact with the system
 *
 * Each file descriptor should correspond to exactly ONE of FileTableEntry
 * B/c each file descriptor can open its file in its individual mode
 * And can seek a file into its individual point
 *
 * Contains:
 * 		reference to inode
 *      reference count for the number of things that have this open
 *      etc.
